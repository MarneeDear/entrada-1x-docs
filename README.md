# Entrada Platform Documentation

The Entrada Platform documentation is stored in markdown files located in the `docs` directory, and then published
using a Python tool called [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org).

To install MkDocs:

1. First check to ensure that you have an adequate version of Python and [pip](http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/stable/installing/) installed:
```
python --version
Python 2.7.2
pip --version
pip 8.0.2 from /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages (python 2.7)
```
2. Use pip to install MkDocs:
```
sudo pip install mkdocs
```
3. Change into this directory and serve up a local documentation development image:
```
cd ~/Desktop/entrada-1x-docs
mkdocs serve
```
