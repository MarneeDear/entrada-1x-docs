# Becoming a Contributor

## Obtaining Contribution Permissions

To contribute any changes to Entrada you must first complete and submit a [Contributors License Agreement](http://www.entrada-project.org/wp-content/uploads/Entrada-CLA.pdf), which provides legal protection for the rest of the Entrada community. You must also register an account at [GitHub](https://github.com), that we will give access to the EntradaProject GitHub organization.

Please submit your CLA and GitHub username via e-mail to [cla@entrada-project.org](mailto:cla@entrada-project.org) for approval. Once your contributor request has been approved, you will be sent a confirmation.

## Committing Changes

Once you have permission to contribute to the Entrada repository, you can commit changes to your local Git repository and push them to GitHub when you are ready to share. Alternatively you can fork the GitHub project and submit pull requests to us.
