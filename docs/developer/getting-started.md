## System Requirements

## Becoming a Contributor

To contribute any changes to Entrada you must first complete and submit a [Contributors License Agreement](http://www.entrada-project.org/wp-content/uploads/Entrada-CLA.pdf), which provides legal protection for the rest of the Entrada community. You must also register an account at [GitHub](https://github.com) that we can give access to the EntradaProject GitHub organization.

Please submit your CLA and GitHub username via e-mail to [cla@entrada-project.org](mailto:cla@entrada-project.org) for approval. Once your contributor request has been approved, you will be sent a confirmation.

Once you have permission to contribute to the Entrada repository, you can commit new features or fixes to a local  `feature` or `hotfix` Git branch, and then push the branch that to the our `entrada-1x-me` repository on GitHub when you are ready to share. Once your completed feature branch is in the `entrada-1x-me` repository create a Pull Request to our `develop` branch, and we will initiate a code review.
